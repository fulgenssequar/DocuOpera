# DocuOpera - A Minimalist Shortkey-Oriented Document Viewer

The On-Screen Reading For Documents Deserves To Be More Convenient!

From now on, when reading documents:

* Jump around positions of a page with merely one key;

* With automatically marked history scopes that makes fast scanning never more convenient;

* With an audio repeater player along with the text, which repeats or forwards fully controlled by shortcuts;

* Make full use of the screen space  without one centimeter waste;

* Inside the browser, with only aid of keyboard, no mouses or touching devices required.

Usage:

* Open index.html inside browser and learn how to use, or -

* View How-To-Use.org for the Detail.
