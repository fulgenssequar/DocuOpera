The On-Screen Reading For Documents Deserves To Be More Convenient!

When reading documents:

* Jump around sections of a page with merely one key, and -

* With automatically marked history scopes that makes fast scanning never more convenient;

* With an audio player along with the text, repeating and forwarding with shortcuts;

* Make full use of the screen space  without one centimeter waste;

* Inside the browser, with only aid of keyboard, no mouses or touching devices required.

Usage:

* Open index.html inside browser and learn how to use, or -

* View How-To-Use.org for the Detail.
